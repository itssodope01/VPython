# VPython: 3D Programming with Python

Welcome to the **VPython** repository, where you can explore various Python programming concepts, from basic Python to more advanced topics like list comprehensions, pi estimation, and 2D random walk simulations. This repository is designed to help beginners and intermediate Python developers get started with essential concepts through simple, illustrative examples.

## Contents

### 1. **Basic Python**
- **Example Codes**: A collection of fundamental Python examples to help you get started. These cover essential concepts such as variables, loops, functions, conditionals, and more.

### 2. **List Comprehension**
- **Solving Problems with List Comprehension**: Learn how to simplify your code and write efficient Python programs using list comprehensions. This section includes practical examples of transforming and filtering lists in Python with concise, one-liner solutions.

### 3. **Pi Calculation**
- **Leibniz Formula**: Estimate the value of pi using the infinite series representation of pi/4. The Leibniz formula provides a simple method to compute pi, although it converges slowly.
- **Monte Carlo Method**: Another approach to estimate pi, using the Monte Carlo method. This technique leverages randomness and probability to calculate pi based on random sampling inside a unit circle.

### 4. **Random Walk Simulation**
- **2D Random Walk**: A simple simulation of a 2D random walk, visualized in the terminal. This example demonstrates how randomness can influence the movement of an object as it "walks" in random directions over time.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itssodope01/VPython.git
   cd VPython
   ```
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. For Python installation, visit [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).

3. To run any of the examples, navigate to the relevant folder and run the Python file:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: The code examples are written in Python 3, so ensure you have the appropriate version installed.
