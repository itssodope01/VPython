# VPython: 3D Programming with Python

Welcome to the **VPython** repository! This project is designed for exploring **VPython**, a powerful tool for creating 3D visualizations using Python. The examples in this repository will help you get started with basic Python concepts and gradually introduce more advanced VPython concepts as new content is added. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn programming or an experienced coder wanting to explore VPython's 3D capabilities, this repository offers practical examples to guide you.

## What to Expect

In this repository, you'll find examples ranging from basic Python syntax and problem-solving techniques to more complex VPython 3D simulations. New code examples and concepts will be added weekly, expanding your understanding of both Python and VPython.

## Contents

### 1. **Basic Python**
- **Example Codes**: A collection of fundamental Python examples to help you get started. These cover essential concepts such as variables, loops, functions, conditionals, and more.

### 2. **List Comprehension**
- **Solving Problems with List Comprehension**: Learn how to simplify your code and write efficient Python programs using list comprehensions. This section includes practical examples of transforming and filtering lists in Python with concise, one-liner solutions.

### 3. **Pi Calculation**
- **Leibniz Formula**: Estimate the value of pi using the infinite series representation of pi/4. The Leibniz formula provides a simple method to compute pi, although it converges slowly.
- **Monte Carlo Method**: Another approach to estimate pi, using the Monte Carlo method. This technique leverages randomness and probability to calculate pi based on random sampling inside a unit circle.

### 4. **Random Walk Simulation**
- **Random Walk**: A simple simulation of a 1D random walk, visualized in the terminal. 

### 5. **Volume Estimation of Hyperspheres**
Estimate the volume of hyperspheres up to 20 dimensions using the Monte Carlo method, NumPy and only one loop in the entire program.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itssodope01/VPython.git
   cd VPython
   ```
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. For Python installation, visit [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).

3. To run any of the examples, navigate to the relevant folder and run the Python file:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: The code examples are written in Python 3, so ensure you have the appropriate version installed.
