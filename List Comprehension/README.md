This folder contains Python scripts for two specific tasks focused on number manipulation and filtering using **list comprehension**, a concise way to create lists in Python. List comprehension allows for constructing lists in a single line of code, enabling more readable and efficient solutions for filtering and transforming data.

### Introduction to List Comprehension
List comprehension provides a syntactic construct to create a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable. It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a `for` clause, and can also include optional `if` clauses to filter items. This powerful feature is especially useful for generating lists based on specific conditions, making code cleaner and more efficient.

### Task 1: Filter Odd Numbers Containing Digits '1' and '5'
In this task, the program utilizes list comprehension to identify and print all odd numbers between 1 and 999 that contain both the digits '1' and '5'. The use of list comprehension allows for a concise expression that effectively filters the desired numbers from the range.

### Task 2: Filter Odd Numbers Containing Digits '1' and '5' (Excluding Those Ending in '1')
This task builds upon Task 1 by refining the criteria to exclude any odd numbers that end with the digit '1'. Again, list comprehension is employed to print the remaining odd numbers that contain both '1' and '5', ensuring that none of these numbers conclude with '1'.
