This folder contains Python programs for various tasks designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts. Below are the details of each task included:

### Task 01: Find Common Elements Between Two Lists
Write a program that takes two lists as input and finds the common elements shared between them. The output should be a list of these common elements.

### Task 02: Sum of Elements in a List
Implement a function to calculate the sum of elements in a list without using the built-in `sum()` function, `range()`, or `while` loops. Explore alternative methods such as recursion or list comprehensions.

### Task 03: Find the First Four Perfect Numbers
Create a program to find the first four perfect numbers. 
- **Perfect Number Definition:** A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. 
- **Reference:** [What is a Perfect Number?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number)

### Task 04: Find smallest positive integer divisible by all integers from 1 to 10`
The following program defines a function that finds the smallest positive integer divisible by all integers from 1 to 10:
